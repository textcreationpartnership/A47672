Jeſus Chriſt hath merited them for her by the effuſion of his Blood, to render her Viſible, Perpetual, and Remarkable, as the moſt happy according to the Fleſh, of all other Republicks, that are, that ſhall be, or that ever were upon Earth.

      * ARTICLE I. According to our Cardinal, there is nothing more important for a Chriſtian, than to be a good Polititian; and it was to inſtruct Chriſtians in the Maxims of the True Policy, that the Cardinal undertook his Hiſtory of the Council of Trent: This Policy is that of the worldly wiſe, for the eſtabliſhing of which, Jeſus Chriſt preached the Goſpel, that he might teach men to be happy in this World and in the other.

And tis made appear that there's none more oppoſite then thoſe of the Crown and of the Church of France, which propoſed no leſs at the Council of Trent, then to throw down the Churches Monarchy and Empire, and to take away the Splendour of the Court of Rome.

      * ARTICLE I. According to our Cardinal, there is nothing more important for a Chriſtian, than to be a good Polititian; and it was to inſtruct Chriſtians in the Maxims of the True Policy, that the Cardinal undertook his Hiſtory of the Council of Trent: This Policy is that of the worldly wiſe, for the eſtabliſhing of which, Jeſus Chriſt preached the Goſpel, that he might teach men to be happy in this World and in the other.
